# Hangman Game

## Description

This Hangman game is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game. The player attempts to guess a word chosen randomly from a list of possible words by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses.

The project consists of two parts:
1. `draft.py` - A preliminary exercise version of the game to practice the basics.
2. `Hangman` class - The real project with an enhanced structure using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Installation

To run the Hangman game, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Timeline

### Draft Version:

Completed on: 17/06/2024
Purpose: Practice and exercise to understand the basics of the game logic.

### Real Project Version:

Completed on: 18/06/2024
Purpose: Implement a more structured and robust version of the game using OOP principles.

## Personal Situation
I created this project as part of my learning journey in Python programming. The draft.py file served as a great exercise to get hands-on experience with basic game logic and user input handling. Moving to the Hangman class, I aimed to improve my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming and create a more maintainable and scalable version of the game.

I hope you find this project as enjoyable and educational as I did while developing it. Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or improvements!



## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
